hArduino
==========
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/LeventErkok/hArduino.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/LeventErkok/hArduino)

This project is still very much WIP. Currently:

   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected via a USB port.
   * You can blink the led on the Arduino Uno. See: [Blink.hs](http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)

Most of the firmata protocol is not yet implemented, and the current code is not quite worthy of
a proper Hackage release yet. Blinking the led (the @hello world@ of the Arduino world)
is pretty much all it can handle for the time being.

Patches and improvements are most welcome!
