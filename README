hArduino
==========

Control your Arduino board from Haskell, using the [Firmata protocol](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page).

This project is still very much WIP. Currently:

   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected.
   * The blink example works! See: [Blink.hs](http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)

Most of the protocol remains unimplemented, and the current code is not worthy of
a proper Hackage release yet. Patches and improvements are most welcome!
