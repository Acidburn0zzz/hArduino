==========

Control your Arduino board from Haskell, using the Firmata protocol.

Not operational by any means yet, still very much WIP. Currently:

   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected.
   * The blink example works! See: [Blink.hs](http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)
