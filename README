hArduino
==========

Control your Arduino board from Haskell, using the Firmata protocol.

This project is still very much WIP. Currently:

   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected.
   * The blink example works! See: [Blink.hs](http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)

Most of the [firmata protocol](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) remains unimplemented.
