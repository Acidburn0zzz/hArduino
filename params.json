Currently:\r\n\r\n   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected via a USB port.\r\n   * You can blink the led on the Arduino Uno. See: [Blink.hs]\r\n(http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)\r\n   * Explore the API on Hackage: [hArduino](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hArduino)\r\n\r\nNote that most of the [Firmata protocol](www.firmata.org) is yet to be implemented. It has just about enough meat to blink the led on the Arduino! I expect to build the library over time to cover all of the protocol: Patches, suggestions, and improvements are most welcome!\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nThe following people reported bugs, provided comments/feedback, or contributed to the development of hArduino in various ways: Alexander Altman."}
