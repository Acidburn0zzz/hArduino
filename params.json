{"body":"hArduino\r\n==========\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LeventErkok/hArduino.png)](http://travis-ci.org/LeventErkok/hArduino)\r\n\r\nThis project is still very much WIP. Currently:\r\n\r\n   * It can identify if an Arduino UNO is connected via a USB port.\r\n   * You can blink the led on the Arduino Uno. See: [Blink.hs]\r\n(http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/System/Hardware/Arduino/Examples/Blink.hs)\r\n   * Explore the API on Hackage: [hArduino](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hArduino)\r\n\r\nMost of the firmata protocol is not yet implemented, and the current code is not quite worthy of\r\na proper Hackage release yet. Blinking the led (the `hello world` of the Arduino world)\r\nis pretty much all it can handle for the time being.\r\n\r\nPatches and improvements are most welcome!","tagline":"Control your Arduino board from Haskell, using the Firmata protocol","note":"Don't delete this file!
